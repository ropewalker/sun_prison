# Sun Prison

Sun Prison (working title) is a WIP turn-based meditation on Rubik's cube, [Sokoban](https://github.com/ropewalker/bevy_sokoban/), and roguelikes, being done with [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/) (and no previous experience in gamedev).

The game is in the *very* early stages of development and is being implemented by a single person ([me](https://github.com/ropewalker)), so not only it is barely playable, but also commit history is a mess and backlog consists mostly of random marginal notes. On the bright side, it is already possible to get lost in the dark or to be eaten by zombies.

Future plans (besides obvious bug fixing and performance updates):

- [ ] UI (or at least some text on the screen);
- [ ] Random map generation;
- [ ] New interactable objects and enemies;
- [ ] Day/night cycle (maybe);
- [ ] Combat;
- [ ] Slightly more interesting win condition;
- [ ] Better art;
- [ ] 3D (maybe, at some point).
