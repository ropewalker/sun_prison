# Sun Prison

Sun Prison (working title) is a WIP turn-based meditation on Rubik's cube, [Sokoban](https://github.com/ropewalker/bevy_sokoban/), and roguelikes, being done with [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/) (and no previous experience in gamedev). 

The game is in a *very* early stage of development and is being implemented by a single developer ([me](https://github.com/ropewalker)), so not only it is barely playable, but also commit history is a mess and backlog consists mostly of random marginal notes. On the bright side, it is already possible to get lost in the dark or to be eaten by zombies.

Future plans (besides obvious bug fixing and performance updates):

- [ ] Random map generation;
- [ ] New interactable objects and enemies;
- [ ] Slightly more interesting win conditions;
- [ ] Better art?
- [ ] 3D (maybe, at some point).
